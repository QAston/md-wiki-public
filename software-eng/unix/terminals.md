## terminals

* most unix software was written against very old hardware for IO - terminals like VT100, VT220, etc
* this is why their configuration refers to very old and archane configuration for input and output
    * it's actually because that configuration is specific to the machines the software was written for at the time
    * this is why readline, vi, emacs and vim are so obscure to configure
* to understand the range of input/output expected/emitted you should look at the manual of machines the software supported
    * in vim/readline you actually bind the handlers to the terminal output sequences of a historical terminal
* terminal emulators like xterm pretend to be that old hardware and provide a way to map the new hardware to the old one, as well as choosing which hardware they pretend to be
* this is why unix software doesn't support modern keyboards - it supports the keyboard output of old terminals
* xterm extens the emulated functions with new stuff by handling new output codes and providing new input as long as the applications are new enough to be accepting and outputting these
    * mouse click escape sequence handling, window labels, etc
* application is told about the terminal providing the io in the config, usually $TERM env variable
* most modern terminals try to be xterm-compatible and thus set the TERM env variable to `xterm` (or variant thereof like xterm-256color)
    * what terminal supports is defined in terminfo and termcap for the given TERM entry
* apparently most emulators don't emulate most of xterm and lack in features

* guide on keycodes (input sequences) from mintty: <https://github.com/mintty/mintty/wiki/Keycodes>
    * ctrl-q in mintty msys then press shows the keycode (filtered through readline?, which seems to eat C1 control block (ctrl+shift+ascii characters))

* notations for keycodes
    * `ESC` a.k.a `^[` a.k.a binary: 0x1b - ESC ASCII control character, nothing to do with the ESC key
        * see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_character> for other named ctrl characters
        * ctrl character is generated by pressing CTRL and a ASCII sign which when binary-anded with 0b11111 gives the control character
        * ctrl-space is the exception, it produces ^"
    * `^[` - ascii control range - caret notation
    * `\e` - same as `ESC`
    * 0x1b - same as `ESC` (also `\u001b`)
    * some named sequences: CSI( `ESC [`), SS3 (`ESC O`), can be found here <https://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html#h3-Controls-beginning-with-ESC>
    * other characters are usually verbatim ascii bytes separated by space, for example: `CSI 1 1 ~`
    * unicode: ` U+0000—U+001F` (C0 controls), `U+007F` (delete), and `U+0080—U+009F` (C1 controls)`
