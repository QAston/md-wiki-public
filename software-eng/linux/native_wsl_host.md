## native wsl host

- makes wsl into an environment which can be used both in and out of hyperv
- using outside of hyperv enables tools which don't work in hyperv like rr and amd hardware perf counters
- because the wsl2 devenv is accessible from both windows and linux, the environment is much less likely to get bitrotten
- for this to work, wsl2 must not have hard dependencies on the windows or linux host, or it must be able to depend on either of these
- things that are host-specific need to be guarded by WSL_DISTRO_NAME env variable existence check

### setup

- install manjaro on a usb drive
-
