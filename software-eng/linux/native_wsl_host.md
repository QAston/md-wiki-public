## native wsl host

- makes wsl into an environment which can be used both in and out of hyperv
- using outside of hyperv enables tools which don't work in hyperv like rr and amd hardware perf counters
- because the wsl2 devenv is accessible from both windows and linux, the environment is much less likely to get bitrotten
- for this to work, wsl2 must not have hard dependencies on the windows or linux host, or it must be able to depend on either of these
- things that are host-specific need to be guarded by WSL_DISTRO_NAME env variable existence check
- if anything needs sharing between the system put it in wsl

### setup on windows

#### disable fast boot and hibernation

- power and sleep settings -> advanced settings -> enable unavailable options -> deselect turn on fast statup -> save changes
- in admin cmd:
```
powercfg.exe /hibernate off
```
- turning off hibernation should disable hybrid sleep, but you can check for it just in case in power plan advanced options

#### create a partition for manjaro

- the partition editor is a bit dumb, create it in partition settings instead, doesn't need to be big as the host system doesn't need much space

### setup

- install manjaro from a usb drive
    - gb keyboard settings
    - gb language and timezone
    - propertiary drivers
- update packages
- configure display settings for 2 monitors
    - search for display settings/manager
